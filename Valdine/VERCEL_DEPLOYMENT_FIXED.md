# ✅ VERCEL DEPLOYMENT - FIXED & LIVE! ✅

## 🎉 **DEPLOYMENT STATUS: READY** 🎉

Your birthday website is now **successfully deployed on Vercel** and **fully functional**!

---

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### **Problem:**
The Vercel build was failing with error:
```
[vite:css] Failed to load PostCSS config: Cannot find module '@tailwindcss/postcss'
```

### **Root Cause:**
The `postcss.config.js` file was trying to use `@tailwindcss/postcss` (Tailwind CSS v4 PostCSS plugin), but:
- The package was not installed in dependencies
- The project uses Tailwind CSS via CDN in the HTML (not as a build dependency)
- PostCSS was not needed for the build

### **Solution:**
Updated `postcss.config.js` to have an empty plugins configuration:
```javascript
// PostCSS config - Tailwind CSS is loaded via CDN in HTML
export default {
  plugins: {},
}
```
